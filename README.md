## Week 1 Weekend Assignment at The Iron Yard

Assignment: Recreate a fake website

4 days of HTML and CSS having known literally 0 HTML or CSS and this is what I
came up with. It's actually mostly *responsive* too. How nifty is that?!

Grueling? Yes.
Worth it? Absolutely.

**HTML, CSS**

First weekend assignment.

Week one of the Iron Yard, we were given an assigment to recreate a website using just HTML and CSS. We had to make it as **responsive** as possible (granted, we were about 5 days in to learning HTML and CSS...5 day old programmers we were) and look good. 

This is an assigment I am really proud of. 

**HTML5, CSS3**
